#+title: Feedback Rohde Todo
* Chapter 2 [0/5]
- [ ]  \( J = -\nabla\mu \) discussed with hasel
- [ ]  \( M(\phi) = 1 \) never used, therefore not well defined
- [ ]  traditional explanation
- [ ]  thermodynamic consistency never explained in my sources
- [ ]  same with energy decay. only that it is required
* Chapter 3 [0/0]
** TODO Improve numerical method explanation [0/4]
- [ ] seperated LES and gaus seidel, multi grid.
- [ ] discrete versions of diff op used in original paper \( \nabla_d \)
- [ ] \( G_{xy} \) is well defined for non integers
- [ ] show 0 neuman boundary conditions through \( G \)
* Chapter 4 [0/3]
- [ ] never did i use absolute meassures
- [ ] sub iteration:
  - [ ] what physical
  - [ ] TODO cauchy convergence criteria adding
- [ ] time convergence, equilibrium to expensive since the experiment scales quadratically. Add that is to expensisive
* Chapter 5 [0/2]
- [ ] energy decay is to complicated for me
- [ ] add initial condition and boundary conds.
* Chapter 6 [0/5]
- [ ] energy decay: behaviour is deffinitly similar!
- [ ] better solver makes them harder to compare.
- [ ] relaxed solver already has some optimizations specific to it.
- [ ] additional equation requires implicit solving and therefore slower convergence
- [ ] subiteration log log plot
